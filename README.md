A powerful and interesting mod that adds several new and useful enchants to Minecraft!


This mod has been first released to the public on the 10th of June 2023 and will be the most commonly used and integrated enchantment mod of all time.

This mod is for **FABRIC ONLY** and will only be maintained in that environment by me. (Herculuke)




Feel free to add something if you want me to look through it and add it :)
